    <section id="intro">
    <p>Paris was alive outside their window, pulsing with life, opportunity, and dreams. But for Sylvie and Jerome, it was a city built on illusions, a place that invited them in only to keep them at arm's length. Being rich, these things are far from easy. They had only what they deserved to have. That was what corresponded to their economic status. The whole of Paris was a perpetual temptation. They decided to give it their all, maybe to become wealthy, but the horizon of their desires was blocked, their dreams belonged to utopia.</p>

    <p>They were happy, found joy in their everyday living, but it was obvious that their current attractions could not suffice from their longings. A war of attrition began, from which it seemed they would never emerge victorious.</p>

    <h2>Sylvie</h2>

    <p>They both worked and both were scared of their work because it required them to borrow, save, and invest. Their hearts were not in their work they thought in terms of all or nothing at all. The bookcase was oak, or it would not be. So it was not. They were in a wait for only a miracle.</p>

    <p>But between these two grand daydreams in which they wallowed with strange self-indulgence, and their total lack of any actual doing; no rational plan; matching the objective necessities to their financial means, arose to fill the gap. The vastness of their desires paralyzed them.</p>

    <p>Lack of directness was almost typical. They were lacking in ease, they were jealous, avid, greedy, tense, and on edge. They lacked tradition and true enjoyment; their pleasures were cerebral, they lacked bodily happiness. What they liked in the things they called luxury was only the money behind them; they loved wealth before they loved life. Jerome glorified what was seen as a caricature of a recent emigrant on a modest salary.</p>

    <p>With the help of accumulated experience, their taste ripened, they matured tastefully. They had burnt what they had worshipped; their palette grew more exquisite. They grew a different taste and they now knew what their happiness would look like. But they were wrong once again. They went into a path where they didn't know the turns or the terminus.</p></div>
